I have an addiction. I like fuzzy things. I find my bag overflowing with small furry animals. I have CorkFu to make sure they all get their exercise, but my backpack is crammed. So I made Kennel to help me out. Every time I visit my pets back in town a random one is swapped in for each one in my bag. Any number of pets can be kept in your bag, Kennel will never add or remove a pet, just randomize the ones you have on you. Holiday pets (ones that need a snowball) are handled separately, so you won't find yourself stuck with holiday pets if you don't have in your bags in the first place.

Kennel will hook into CorkFu if present, so that you know when you need to put a new pet out.
