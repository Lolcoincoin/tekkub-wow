!FuzzyLogic condenses Mend, Call, Dismiss and Revive Pet down into a single keybind or macro.  !FuzzyLogic is smart enough to know if your pet is dead, even if it's corpse has despawned.  Mend pet is cast if your pet's HP% is < 90%.

!FuzzyLogic will only load on hunters, it will disable itsself if loaded on any other class.

The prefered means of triggering !FuzzyLogic is a simple macro:
_WoW Patch 2.0.3 is required for this to work_

If you wish to change the threshold for Mend/Dismiss pet out of combat, edit this line of !FuzzyLogic.lua:
{{{
local healthresh = 0.90
}}}

To use a ketbind instead of a macro, edit this line in !FuzzyLogic.lua:
{{{
local binding
}}}
For example, to bind to Ctrl-P:
{{{
local binding = "CTRL-P"
}}}
