== v2.0 ==
 * Now shows GC statistics for each addon (will extend loadtime, but tells you how much
time was spent on this extra GC)
 * Savedvar log improved, now dumps strings that watch the in-game output
 * Added memory and time stack to show proper stats for addons that call LoadAddOn while
they are loading
