--~ 20) "Bring Me Kel'gash's Head!" (Elite) (he's at 65.79, I'm usually able to solo him at level 18, either find a group to help you kill him or you could come back later at like LVL 19/20 and try again, there is no follow up quest to it, so it can be skipped)
--~ 21) Then go do "Deactivate An'owyn"

--~ 48) Teleport to the Undercity!  (at 49.14)
--~ 49) Now, it comes down to a path of choice from here on out, you could either go to Hillsbrad Foothills, or to Stonetalon Mountains/Southern Barrens.  I choose Stonetalon Mountains/Southern Barrens because it would be away from the Alliance, so you can focus on faster leveling, if your more of a PVP type you could go to Hillsbrad instead (that is if you are on a PVP server of course).  I also feel there are more quests to do in in Kalimdor rather than Eastern Kingdoms.  So my guide will continue on at The Barrens...
--~ 50) I SKIP "Journey to Undercity" and "Envoy to the Horde" (only do this if you are going to do Hillsbrad instead)
--~ 51) Then get on the zeppelin to go to Orgrimmar
--~ 52) Get FP in Orgrimmar
--~ 53) Then run all the way to the XRs (Crossroads) in the Barrens...
